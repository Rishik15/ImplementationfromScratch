## Machine Learning Models from Scratch

This repository contains machine learning models implemented from scratch using Python.

The goal is to understand how these algorithms work internally by writing them without using machine learning libraries. Each model is built by focusing on the core logic behind it.

This is a learning project to explore the fundamentals of machine learning.
